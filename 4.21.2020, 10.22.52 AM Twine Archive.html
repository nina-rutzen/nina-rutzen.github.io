Main Argument: gender construction is a cyclical process in which, throughout time, the choices that someone makes work towards reconstructing what it means to be a certain gender, therefore redefining the definition of male and female for every generation thereafter
My thesis is based on redfining [[what it means]] to be a man or a woman</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="2" name="Method Source 1" tags="" position="376,350" size="100,100">#Butler, &quot;Sex and Gender in Simone de Beauvoir&#39;s Second Sex&quot;

#In My Paper
This adds a lot to my argument because I am talking about the contruction of gender and how it changes from generation to generation, as does the shift of the culture
I will also mention how the acceptance of the cultural impositions that Butler speaks of influence the way in which gender is constructed</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="3" name="Exhibit Source" tags="" position="625,350" size="100,100">#Bandersnatch

#In My Paper
I am going to talk about the decisions that Stefan made and how they are partially due to the culture at that time, but also because of how men are consistently periceved throughout time, and Stefan wants to stay within the confines of the male gender
I will also mention how Stefan&#39;s choices, based on each choice, reflect his desire to have masculinity or his wish to be masculine</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="5" name="Stefan&#39;s Father&#39;s Decision Making" tags="" position="249,500" size="100,100">#Stefan&#39;s Father&#39;s Decision Making
